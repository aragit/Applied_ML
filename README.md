# Applied_ML
Applying machine learning is hard. Many organizations have yet to benefit from ML, and most teams still find it tricky to apply it effectively.

Though there are many ML courses, most focus on theory and students finish without knowing how to apply ML. Practical know-how is gained via hands-on experience and seldom documented—it's hard to find it in a textbook, class, or tutorial. There's a gap between knowing ML vs. applying it at work.

### 🌟 Applied Machine Learning

Applying machine learning is hard. Many organizations have yet to benefit from ML, and most teams still find it tricky to apply it effectively.

Though there are many ML courses, most focus on theory and students finish without knowing how to apply ML. Practical know‑how is gained via hands‑on experience and seldom documented—it’s hard to find it in a textbook, class, or tutorial. There’s a gap between knowing ML vs. applying it at work.

**This repository** aims to close that gap by collecting state‑of‑the‑art recipes, patterns, and code snippets I’ve developed across:

- **Work projects:** real‑world constraints, data quirks, and deployment challenges  
- **Kaggle competitions:** winning tricks for feature engineering, modeling, and tuning  
- **Side projects & experiments:** new libraries, emerging architectures, and failure post‑mortems  

### What you’ll find here

- ** Pattern Gallery**  
  Reusable “how‑to” recipes for data prep, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and monitoring.

- ** Case Studies**  
  End‑to‑end mini‑projects illustrating the complete ML lifecycle—from raw data through production‑ready model.

- **📓 Cheatsheets & Utilities**  
  Handy snippets (e.g. hyperparameter search loops, custom metrics, deployment helpers) you can drop into your own code.

- **🧪 Experiments & Benchmarks**  
  Comparisons of algorithms, libraries, and hardware (CPU vs. GPU vs. TPU) on standard and proprietary datasets.

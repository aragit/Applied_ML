# Applied_ML
Applying machine learning is hard. Many organizations have yet to benefit from ML, and most teams still find it tricky to apply it effectively.

Though there are many ML courses, most focus on theory and students finish without knowing how to apply ML. Practical know-how is gained via hands-on experience and seldom documentedâ€”it's hard to find it in a textbook, class, or tutorial. There's a gap between knowing ML vs. applying it at work.
